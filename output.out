---

To submit a screenshot, simply post it as an answer to this question, but please take note of the following:

- One screenshot per post, and one post per person, please!
- Limited picture modifications are allowed, such as cropping, simple filters, and blurring of identifying info such as names, but not adding other images or text. 
- To ensure a fair playing field, please post screenshots you've taken yourself rather than ones you found online. 
- Stack Exchange’s [Code of Conduct][code of conduct] still applies - so if it would be unacceptable to post normally, it’s unacceptable here. 

Also, try to avoid pictures that include spoilers. We want everyone to be able to enjoy this contest, so the less spoilers the better.

### How long will the contest run?
We will accept submissions for a week, until 19:00 UTC of 2023-03-13, then have a second week-long period where only voting will be accepted. This is to give every submission, even those posted at the end of the first week, a chance to be voted on by everyone. 

After the end of the second week, at 19:00 UTC of 2023-03-20, we will count upvotes only to determine the winning screenshot, which will be featured for a week on the main site's photo widget.
